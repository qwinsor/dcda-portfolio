            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For lab 2 of this semesters work I have decided to evaluate the two AI engines Notebook Lm and Leonardo AI. I thought this would be an interesting comparison because they serve completely different purposes. One being an image generator and another aimed toward helping individuals learn.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: Leonardo Ai</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>As the name suggests this tool is very good at creating images. There are many styles, aspect ratios and forms of media that this tool can generate so it leaves you with a lot of options to explore. It seems to also have different models you can choose from to achieve different styles of art including some decent videos. I found that most of the images generated served their purpose well, and as long as I gave a prompt that the AI could work with, the image was fine. However, there happened to be a LOT of things that this tool could not achieve. For starters, this tool can't do very much research. For example, when I asked it to make a picture of Anakin Skywalker using the force, it had no idea what that was or how to show it. It couldn't make an image with Batman using his gadgets, and it couldnt make an image teaching me anything about drilling oil, other than what a pump and oil crew looked like. It also wasnt very robust, meaning if I gave it the same prompt twice, they would be completely different images in about half of the cases. When typed in "write an essay about drilling oil" it spit out two different images of the same oil rig and crew, however one was cartoon style and the other was realistic. When I did the same with "TCU hockey game, make no players wear number 7" it first showed me a 300's distance of an unrecogniable organization (with multiple players wearing number 7) then it showed a weird picture depicting a TCU hockey player with a Giant X over it. This ties into its next limitation which is that it cannot handle following contrains very well. If I were to give it a specific thing that it should not do, it would almost always do exactly that. I would have loved to have had more time to see just how far I could push Leonardo AI, however it limited me to 20 prompts. Unfortunate.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>Some of the cases in which I would definately use this product are if I need to make a quick peice of art that generally gets the idea across. Things like scenes in nature, charecters of fiction or history, or objects are great. I would imagine if I were to throw a themed party This tool would be great for some posters. I would not use it for anything informative. It couldn't do any real research, and its facts are often wrong unless they are surface level things like batmans appearance. /p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Unfortunatly tools like this can be used for all kinds of horrible things. Scams, deepfakes, propaganda, you name it. This issue started arrising many years ago when this technology first came out, and now its been refined to the point that some of these images and videos look more real than videos from the early 2000's. I did not test any of these unethical capabilities because I obviously don't agree with that, but I have seen plenty of pretty awful things on social media. That being said it comes down the the users of these tools, and hope that everyone will choose to do the right thing.</p>
