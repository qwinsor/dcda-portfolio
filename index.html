            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Lab 1: I learned the basics of adding pictures and files into VScode so that they can be used on my website. I also learned how to adjust colors, fonts, spacing, and simple things of that nature.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> Lab 1 : It was a little difficult for me to remember all the steps for things like adding an image, but once I remembered them all the order didnt really matter. Also I didnt put the code in properly, so I had to look over all my work.</p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> Lab 1: I feel a lot more comfortable with the interfaces and softwares. I feel a lot more confident going in to lab 2.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> Lab 2: I feel as if these skills will be used for the remainder of my time coding. I am confident they will be used in every website that I build.</p>
